# Weaver — Implementation Plan

_Read `CLAUDE.md` before starting any task. Mark tasks `- [x]` when complete. Update `memory.md` after each phase._

---

## Phase 1 — Project Foundation: Types, IPC, and On-Disk Structure

These tasks establish the data model and file I/O layer everything else builds on. Do these first.

---

- [x] **T-001 — Define shared TypeScript types** ⚠️ NEEDS REWORK — `Project` is missing the `chapters` manifest field
  - **Goal**: Create a single source-of-truth for all domain types used across frontend and IPC boundary.
  - **Files to modify**: `src/types/index.ts` (file already exists; update `Project`)
  - **Types to define**:
    - `Project { id, title, author, created: string, rootPath: string, chapters: string[] }` — `chapters` is an **ordered array of chapter filenames** (the manifest). This is the source of truth for chapter order.
    - `Chapter { id, title, filename, order: number, wordCount?: number }` — `order` is the chapter's index in the manifest (0-based), derived at read time; not stored in the filename.
    - `CodexEntry { id, title, category, filename }`
    - `OutlineItem { id, chapterId, text, anchorId: string, type: string }` — `type` is a free-form string (e.g. "Note", "Todo", "Feedback", or anything the user defines). `anchorId` is a UUID matching a `<!-- weaver-anchor:UUID -->` comment in the chapter's Markdown. No character offsets — the anchor travels with the text.
    - `Theme { name, fontFamily, fontSize, lineHeight, backgroundColor, textColor, accentColor }`
  - **Depends on**: nothing
  - **Fits architecture**: These types are passed across the Tauri IPC boundary (frontend calls Rust commands and receives these shapes). Define them once here; Rust structs mirror them.

---

- [x] **T-002 — Add Rust structs mirroring TypeScript types** ⚠️ NEEDS REWORK — `Project` struct is missing `chapters: Vec<String>`
  - **Goal**: Define serde-serializable Rust structs for all domain objects, used as Tauri command return types.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Structs**: `Project`, `Chapter`, `CodexEntry`, `OutlineItem`, `Theme` — all `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]`
  - **`Project` must include**: `pub chapters: Vec<String>` — the ordered manifest of chapter filenames.
  - **`OutlineItem` must use**: `pub anchor_id: String` instead of `anchor_offset`/`anchor_length`; `pub item_type: String` (plain string, not an enum — user-defined types must round-trip without a code change).
  - **Depends on**: T-001 (to stay in sync)
  - **Fits architecture**: Tauri commands serialise these structs to JSON; TypeScript deserialises to the types from T-001.

---

- [x] **T-003 — Implement Tauri commands: create_project, open_project** ⚠️ NEEDS REWORK — `project.json` must include `chapters: []`; open_project must return it
  - **Goal**: Allow the app to create a new project directory structure on disk, or open an existing one.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
  - **Cargo dependencies already added**: `uuid` (v4), `chrono` (with serde feature)
  - **Commands**:
    - `create_project(title: String, author: String, path: String) -> Result<Project, String>`
      - Creates `<path>/<title>/` directory tree: `chapters/`, `codex/characters/`, `codex/places/`, `codex/items/`, `themes/`
      - Writes `project.json` with `chapters: []` (empty manifest — no chapters yet)
      - Returns `Project` (with `chapters: vec![]`)
    - `open_project(path: String) -> Result<Project, String>`
      - Reads and parses `project.json` from path — must deserialize `chapters` array
      - Returns `Project` including the `chapters` manifest
  - **Depends on**: T-002
  - **Fits architecture**: All file I/O goes through Tauri commands. Frontend uses `invoke('create_project', {...})`.

---

- [x] **T-004 — Implement Tauri commands: chapter CRUD** ⚠️ NEEDS REWORK — current implementation encodes order in filename prefix; must be rewritten for manifest-based ordering
  - **Goal**: Create, list, read, and save chapter files. Order is stored in `project.json`'s `chapters` manifest, not in filenames.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Key design decisions**:
    - Chapter filenames are `slug.md` (no numeric prefix). Example: `the-dark-forest.md`.
    - `project.json` contains `"chapters": ["intro.md", "the-dark-forest.md", ...]` — this ordered array is the sole source of truth for chapter order.
    - The `order` field on `Chapter` is the 0-based index of the filename in the manifest — derived at read time, never persisted on its own.
    - Any write that changes the manifest (create, delete, rename, reorder) must atomically update `project.json`.
  - **Commands**:
    - `list_chapters(project_path: String) -> Result<Vec<Chapter>, String>`
      - Reads `project.json`, iterates `chapters` array in order
      - For each filename, sets `order` = index, derives title from filename slug (replace `-` with spaces, capitalise first letter)
      - Skips filenames not found on disk (graceful degradation)
    - `read_chapter(project_path: String, filename: String) -> Result<String, String>` — unchanged, reads raw Markdown
    - `save_chapter(project_path: String, filename: String, content: String) -> Result<(), String>` — unchanged, atomic write+rename
    - `create_chapter(project_path: String, title: String) -> Result<Chapter, String>`
      - Slugifies title → `slug.md`; if file already exists, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.
      - Creates empty `.md` file
      - Appends filename to `chapters` array in `project.json`
      - Returns `Chapter` with `order` = new last index
    - `rename_chapter(project_path: String, filename: String, new_title: String) -> Result<Chapter, String>`
      - Renames `.md` file and sidecar `.notes.json` (if present) on disk
      - Updates the entry in `project.json`'s `chapters` array (old filename → new filename)
      - Returns updated `Chapter`
    - `delete_chapter(project_path: String, filename: String) -> Result<(), String>`
      - Deletes `.md` file and sidecar `.notes.json` (if present)
      - Removes filename from `project.json`'s `chapters` array
    - `reorder_chapters(project_path: String, filenames: Vec<String>) -> Result<(), String>` ← **new command**
      - Accepts the full desired chapter order as a list of filenames
      - Validates that the list contains the same set of filenames currently in the manifest (no additions or removals)
      - Writes the new order back to `project.json`'s `chapters` array
  - **Helpers to add**: `read_project_json(path) -> Result<Project, String>`, `write_project_json(path, project) -> Result<(), String>` — used by all commands that touch the manifest
  - **Helpers to remove**: `chapter_from_filename` (numeric prefix parsing), `next_chapter_order` — these are artifacts of the filename-based approach
  - **Depends on**: T-003
  - **Fits architecture**: Atomic save (write+rename) prevents data loss on crash. Manifest in `project.json` makes reordering a first-class operation with no filesystem renames.

---

- [x] **T-005 — Implement Tauri commands: codex CRUD**
  - **Goal**: Create, list, read, and save codex entries.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Commands**:
    - `list_codex(project_path: String) -> Result<Vec<CodexEntry>, String>` — walks `codex/` subdirectories
    - `read_codex_entry(project_path: String, category: String, filename: String) -> Result<String, String>`
    - `save_codex_entry(project_path: String, category: String, filename: String, content: String) -> Result<(), String>`
    - `create_codex_entry(project_path: String, category: String, title: String) -> Result<CodexEntry, String>`
    - `delete_codex_entry(project_path: String, category: String, filename: String) -> Result<(), String>`
  - **Depends on**: T-003
  - **Fits architecture**: Same pattern as chapter commands.

---

- [x] **T-006 — Implement Tauri commands: outline/notes CRUD**
  - **Goal**: Read/write the `.notes.json` sidecar files that store outline items anchored to chapter text.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Commands**:
    - `read_outline(project_path: String, chapter_filename: String) -> Result<Vec<OutlineItem>, String>`
    - `save_outline(project_path: String, chapter_filename: String, items: Vec<OutlineItem>) -> Result<(), String>`
  - **Depends on**: T-004
  - **Fits architecture**: Sidecar JSON file lives next to the `.md` file with the same base name.

---

- [x] **T-007 — Create Tauri IPC helper module on the frontend**
  - **Goal**: Wrap all `invoke` calls in typed async functions so components never call `invoke` directly.
  - **Files to create**: `src/lib/tauri.ts`
  - **Exports**: one async function per Tauri command (e.g. `createProject(...)`, `listChapters(...)`, etc.), with full TypeScript types from T-001.
  - **Depends on**: T-001, T-003, T-004, T-005, T-006
  - **Fits architecture**: Centralises the IPC boundary. If a command signature changes, only this file needs updating.

---

## Phase 2 — Project Management UI

Wire up project open/create and chapter navigation. No editor persistence yet.

---

- [x] **T-008 — Create ProjectContext**
  - **Goal**: React context that holds active project state, chapter list, and selected chapter.
  - **Files to create**: `src/contexts/ProjectContext.tsx`
  - **State**: `project: Project | null`, `chapters: Chapter[]`, `activeChapter: Chapter | null`, `setActiveChapter`, `refreshChapters`
  - **Depends on**: T-001, T-007
  - **Fits architecture**: ProjectContext wraps App; all components that need project state consume it.

---

- [x] **T-009 — Build Welcome / Project Open screen**
  - **Goal**: When no project is open, show a welcome screen with "New Project" and "Open Project" buttons.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`
  - **Files to modify**: `src/App.tsx` (conditionally render WelcomeScreen vs. main layout)
  - **Behaviour**:
    - "New Project" opens a simple form (title, author, pick folder via Tauri dialog)
    - "Open Project" opens a folder picker dialog, calls `open_project`
    - On success, sets project in ProjectContext
  - **New Cargo dependency needed**: Add `tauri-plugin-dialog` to `Cargo.toml` and capabilities for folder picker
  - **Depends on**: T-007, T-008
  - **Fits architecture**: Gated entry point; once project is open, the main editor layout renders.

---

- [x] **T-010 — Build left navigation pane (content view + file view)**
  - **Goal**: A fixed-width left sidebar that serves as the primary navigation pane. Has two modes toggled by an icon or tab strip at the top.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/LeftPane.tsx`, `src/components/ChapterList.tsx`, `src/components/FileExplorer.tsx`, `src/components/FileEditor.tsx`
  - **Files to modify**: `src/App.tsx` — update from 2-pane to **3-pane** layout: `[left nav] [editor] [right tools]`. Left pane and right sidebar are both fixed-width and independently collapsible; editor takes `flex-1`.
  - **Content view** (default mode):
    - Lists chapters in manifest order; click to open in editor; "+" creates a new chapter; right-click or icon to rename/delete.
    - Below chapters: collapsible codex section listing entries by category.
    - Current chapter highlighted.
  - **File view** (raw mode):
    - Renders the project directory tree (`chapters/`, `codex/`, `themes/`, `project.json`, etc.).
    - Clicking any file opens it in a `FileEditor` — a plain `<textarea>` that replaces the Lexical editor in the center pane for that file.
    - `FileEditor` saves on Ctrl+S via `save_raw_file` Tauri command (see note below).
    - This is how users edit metadata files (`project.json`, a future `metadata.yaml`, etc.) without needing a separate settings screen.
  - **New Tauri commands needed** (add to T-004's scope or implement here): `read_raw_file(project_path, relative_path) -> Result<String, String>`, `save_raw_file(project_path, relative_path, content) -> Result<(), String>`
  - **Depends on**: T-007, T-008
  - **Fits architecture**: Left pane is navigation; right sidebar is tools. File view makes the project structure transparent without breaking the writing UX.

---

## Phase 3 — Editor Persistence

Connect the Lexical editor to file I/O.

---

- [x] **T-011 — Add Markdown ↔ Lexical serialization**
  - **Goal**: Convert between raw Markdown strings (stored on disk) and Lexical editor state.
  - **Files to create**: `src/lib/markdown.ts`
  - **Approach**:
    - Add `@lexical/markdown` as a dependency in `package.json`.
    - Define a `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS` constant: `export const WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS = [...TRANSFORMERS]` (re-exports the standard CommonMark set from `@lexical/markdown`). **This array is the extension point** — future Pandoc-specific transformers (footnotes, etc.) are added here without touching anything else.
    - All serialization in this file uses `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS`, never `TRANSFORMERS` directly.
    - Include a custom `AnchorTransformer` in `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS` that handles `<!-- weaver-anchor:UUID -->` comments: on import, creates an invisible `AnchorNode`; on export, serializes back to the comment. (See T-014 for the `AnchorNode` definition.)
  - **Exports**: `markdownToEditorState(markdown: string, editor: LexicalEditor): void`, `editorStateToMarkdown(state: EditorState): string`, `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS`
  - **YAML frontmatter**: not handled here. pandoc-publish uses a separate metadata file, not inline frontmatter — that file is edited via the raw `FileEditor` in the file view (T-010). No frontmatter transformer needed.
  - **Depends on**: T-014 (for `AnchorNode` and `AnchorTransformer`) — implement T-014's node definition before finalising T-011, or stub the transformer and fill it in during T-014.
  - **Fits architecture**: All Markdown conversion goes through one file. Adding Pandoc extensions later = add to `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS`, done.

---

- [x] **T-012 — Multi-instance chapter editor (ChapterStackManager)**
  - **Goal**: Replace the single shared `Editor` with a stack of independent per-chapter editor instances. Each instance is permanently bound to one chapter file. Save logic lives in the parent (`ChapterStackManager`), not inside the editor. A file overwrite caused by stale component state is architecturally impossible.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/ChapterStackManager.tsx`, `src/components/ChapterEditorLayer.tsx`
  - **Files to modify**: `src/Editor.tsx` (simplify — strip all save/load/chapter logic), `src/App.tsx` (replace `<Editor />` with `<ChapterStackManager />`)

  ### Editor.tsx — simplified to a pure editing surface
  - **Props**: `initialContent: string`, `onContentChange: (markdown: string) => void`
  - An `InitialContentPlugin` (defined in this file) runs `markdownToEditorState(initialContent, editor)` in a `useEffect` with empty deps — fires exactly once at mount, never again.
  - To prevent the initial load from triggering dirty state: use a `mountedRef` boolean in `InitialContentPlugin` that is `false` for the first `onContentChange` call (which comes from the mount load), then `true` for all subsequent ones. Pass `isMounted` up alongside the markdown so `ChapterStackManager` can ignore the first emission.
  - **Alternative**: use `OnChangePlugin`'s `onChange` callback which receives `{ tags }` — skip calls where `tags` contains a load tag. Either approach is fine; implementer's choice.
  - `EditorRefPlugin` stays — still sets the editor in `EditorContext` for `OutlinePanel`.
  - No Ctrl+S handler. No save calls. No project/chapter context imports.

  ### ChapterEditorLayer.tsx — one-to-one wrapper per chapter
  - **Props**: `chapter: Chapter`, `initialContent: string`, `visible: boolean`, `onContentChange: (markdown: string) => void`
  - Renders `<Editor initialContent={initialContent} onContentChange={onContentChange} />`
  - Visibility: wrap in a `<div className={visible ? 'contents' : 'hidden'}>`. `hidden` = `display:none` — the editor stays mounted and keeps all Lexical state (including undo history), it just isn't painted.
  - `chapter.filename` is used as the `key` by `ChapterStackManager` — never changes for this instance.

  ### ChapterStackManager.tsx — owns all open editors and save logic
  - **State**:
    - `openChapters: { chapter: Chapter, initialContent: string }[]` — append-only during a session; items are removed only when explicitly closed
    - `activeFilename: string | null`
    - `loadingFilenames: Set<string>` — prevents double-loading the same chapter
  - **Refs** (not state — must not trigger re-renders):
    - `latestContent: Map<string, string>` — updated on every `onContentChange` from any layer; initialized to `initialContent` when a layer is pushed
    - `saveTimers: Map<string, ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>` — one debounce timer per open chapter

  - **`openChapter(chapter)`** (called from a `useEffect` watching `ProjectContext.activeChapter`):
    1. If `activeFilename === chapter.filename`: no-op (already active)
    2. If in `openChapters`: set `activeFilename = chapter.filename`, done
    3. If in `loadingFilenames`: no-op (load already in progress)
    4. Otherwise: add to `loadingFilenames`, call `readChapter(project.rootPath, chapter.filename)`, on success:
       - Initialize `latestContent.set(filename, content)`
       - Append `{ chapter, initialContent: content }` to `openChapters`
       - Set `activeFilename = filename`
       - Remove from `loadingFilenames`

  - **`onContentChange(filename, markdown)`** (called by each layer):
    - Update `latestContent.set(filename, markdown)`
    - Mark `filename` as dirty (a `Set<string>` in state for the UI indicator)
    - Reset that chapter's debounce timer: clear existing, set new 1s timer that calls `flush(filename)`

  - **`flush(filename)`**: calls `saveChapter(project.rootPath, filename, latestContent.get(filename))`, on success marks `filename` clean

  - **Ctrl+S**: `onKeyDown` on the outer wrapper `<div>` — when `ctrlKey/metaKey + S`: prevent default, clear `saveTimers.get(activeFilename)`, call `flush(activeFilename)` immediately

  - **Close a chapter**: clear its debounce timer, flush synchronously (fire-and-forget), remove from `openChapters`; if it was active, activate the next/previous open chapter

  - **Renders**: all `ChapterEditorLayer` instances stacked with `position: absolute, inset-0`. Active one has `visible={true}`; others have `visible={false}`. When `openChapters` is empty, render a placeholder ("Open a chapter to start writing").

  - **Dirty indicator**: the dirty `Set<string>` can be used to show a dot on the chapter name in the `ChapterList` (pass via context or callback) — implement the indicator if easy, defer if not.

  ### Why this is safe
  - `latestContent.get(filename)` and `filename` are always the same key — they cannot refer to different chapters.
  - No component ever reads `editor.getEditorState()` directly for saving; content always arrives via the `onContentChange` callback after Lexical has applied it.
  - Switching chapters never modifies an existing editor instance's state. It only changes which one is visible.

  - **Depends on**: T-007, T-008, T-011
  - **Auto-save setting** (T-019): when `SettingsContext` is implemented, read `autoSave` in `ChapterStackManager` and skip scheduling the debounce timer if disabled. Ctrl+S always works regardless.

---

## Phase 4 — Sidebar Panel System

Build the infrastructure for swappable right-sidebar panels before implementing individual panels.

---

- [x] **T-013 — Build sidebar panel shell**
  - **Goal**: Replace the placeholder sidebar div with a panel system: an icon strip on the right edge + a content area that renders the active panel.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/SidebarIcon.tsx`
  - **Files to modify**: `src/App.tsx`
  - **Panels**: Outline, Codex, (AI placeholder). Each icon toggles its panel open/closed. Only one panel visible at a time. Sidebar collapses to icon strip when no panel is active. _(Preview panel removed — Lexical is a rich text editor, so the editor itself is the rendered view.)_
  - **Depends on**: T-008 (needs project context for Codex/Outline)
  - **Fits architecture**: Single swappable sidebar area per ARCHITECTURE.md and the sidebar model decision in `memory.md`.

---

## Phase 5 — Outline Panel

---

- [x] **T-014 — Build Outline panel UI + AnchorNode**
  - **Goal**: Show outline items for the active chapter. Allow adding, editing, deleting items. Define the `AnchorNode` Lexical type used by the anchor system.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/panels/OutlinePanel.tsx`, `src/nodes/AnchorNode.tsx`
  - **AnchorNode** (define first — T-011 depends on it):
    - A custom Lexical inline decorator node that holds a `anchorId: string` (UUID).
    - Renders as a zero-width, invisible `<span data-anchor-id="UUID">` in the editor — users never see it.
    - Serializes to/from `<!-- weaver-anchor:UUID -->` in Markdown via the `AnchorTransformer` registered in `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS` (T-011).
    - Moves with surrounding text as the user edits — this is the whole point.
  - **OutlinePanel features**:
    - List outline items grouped by type — groups are derived dynamically from the unique `type` strings present in the current chapter's outline items, so user-defined types appear automatically
    - "Add item" at cursor: generates a UUID, inserts an `AnchorNode` at the current editor selection, saves the `OutlineItem` to the sidecar `.notes.json`; type field is a text input that suggests "Note", "Todo", "Feedback" but accepts any free-form string
    - Click an item → find the `AnchorNode` with matching `anchorId` in the editor and scroll/focus to it
    - Item text field editable inline; delete removes the item from `.notes.json` and removes the `AnchorNode` from the document
  - **Depends on**: T-006, T-007, T-008, T-013
  - **Fits architecture**: Anchors live in the Markdown file as HTML comments — invisible in pandoc output, stable across edits, no offset fragility.

---

- [ ] **T-015 — Implement outline ↔ editor position sync**
  - **Goal**: As the cursor moves in the editor, highlight the outline item whose `AnchorNode` is nearest behind the cursor. Clicking an outline item scrolls the editor to its anchor.
  - **Files to modify**: `src/Editor.tsx`, `src/components/panels/OutlinePanel.tsx`
  - **Approach**:
    - **Cursor → outline**: register a Lexical `registerUpdateListener`. On each update, walk the node tree to find all `AnchorNode` instances and their positions. Determine which anchor is closest before the current selection offset. Emit the active `anchorId` via a shared ref or context so `OutlinePanel` can highlight the corresponding item.
    - **Outline → cursor**: expose a `scrollToAnchor(anchorId: string)` imperative function from the editor (via `useImperativeHandle` or a ref callback). `OutlinePanel` calls this on item click. The function queries the editor state for the `AnchorNode` with the matching key, then calls `node.selectEnd()` and scrolls the DOM node into view.
  - **Depends on**: T-014
  - **Fits architecture**: Standard Lexical listener/query pattern. No character offsets anywhere in this implementation.

---

## Phase 6 — Codex Panel

---

- [ ] **T-016 — Build Codex panel UI**
  - **Goal**: Browse, create, and edit codex entries within the sidebar.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/panels/CodexPanel.tsx`
  - **Features**:
    - Category tabs or collapsible groups (Characters, Places, Items, + custom)
    - Entry list; click an entry to open it in an inline editor within the panel
    - "New entry" creates a file via T-005 commands
    - Entry content editable via a **full Lexical editor instance** (same `RichTextPlugin` + `HistoryPlugin` setup as the chapter editor, with the same Markdown ↔ Lexical serialization from T-011). Writers may want bold/italic/etc. in reference notes.
    - Save on the same pattern as chapters: Ctrl+S + auto-save if enabled
  - **Depends on**: T-005, T-007, T-008, T-011, T-013
  - **Fits architecture**: Reuses the Lexical + Markdown serialization layer. The codex editor is a second Lexical composer instance scoped to the sidebar — it does not share state with the chapter editor.

---

## Phase 7 — Editor Formatting Toolbar

---

- [x] **T-017 — Register Lexical node types and add formatting toolbar**
  - **Goal**: Register the Lexical node types required by the Markdown transformers, add the necessary Lexical plugins, and build a formatting toolbar above the editor.
  - **Why this is critical**: Currently only `AnchorNode` is registered. The `TRANSFORMERS` from `@lexical/markdown` reference `HeadingNode`, `QuoteNode`, `ListNode`, `ListItemNode`, `CodeNode`, `CodeHighlightNode`, and `LinkNode` — none of which are registered. Markdown with headings, lists, or other block-level formatting loads incorrectly without these.
  - **New dependencies** (add to `package.json`): `@lexical/list`, `@lexical/link`, `@lexical/code`
  - **Files to modify**: `src/Editor.tsx`, `package.json`
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/EditorToolbar.tsx`
  - **Node registration** (add to `initialConfig.nodes` in `Editor.tsx`):
    - `HeadingNode` (from `@lexical/rich-text`)
    - `QuoteNode` (from `@lexical/rich-text`)
    - `ListNode`, `ListItemNode` (from `@lexical/list`)
    - `CodeNode`, `CodeHighlightNode` (from `@lexical/code`)
    - `LinkNode`, `AutoLinkNode` (from `@lexical/link`)
  - **Plugins to add** (inside `LexicalComposer`):
    - `ListPlugin` (from `@lexical/react/LexicalListPlugin`) — required for list behavior
    - `LinkPlugin` (from `@lexical/react/LexicalLinkPlugin`) — required for link behavior
    - `MarkdownShortcutPlugin` with `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS` — lets users type `# `, `- `, `> `, `` ``` ``, `**`, `_` etc. and get live formatting (Obsidian-like shortcuts within the rich text editor)
  - **Theme classes** (extend the `theme` object in `Editor.tsx`):
    - Add classes for `heading.h1`, `heading.h2`, `heading.h3`, `quote`, `list.ul`, `list.ol`, `list.listitem`, `code`, `codeHighlight`, `link`, `text.bold`, `text.italic`, `text.strikethrough`, `text.code`
  - **EditorToolbar component**:
    - Fixed bar above the `ContentEditable`, inside the `LexicalComposer` tree (needs editor context)
    - Buttons: **Bold**, _Italic_, ~~Strikethrough~~, `Code`, H1, H2, H3, Bullet List, Numbered List, Blockquote, Code Block, Link
    - Each button dispatches the appropriate Lexical command (e.g. `FORMAT_TEXT_COMMAND` for bold/italic, `INSERT_ORDERED_LIST_COMMAND` for numbered list, etc.)
    - Active state: buttons reflect current selection formatting (bold button highlighted when cursor is in bold text, etc.) via `$getSelection()` inspection in an update listener
    - Styled as a minimal, dark toolbar consistent with the zinc palette — not floating, not intrusive
    - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+B (bold), Ctrl+I (italic), Ctrl+Shift+S (strikethrough) come free with `RichTextPlugin`; Markdown shortcuts come free with `MarkdownShortcutPlugin`
  - **Depends on**: T-011, T-012
  - **Fits architecture**: Toolbar is a fixed bar, not a floating menu (per ARCHITECTURE.md). Node registration is prerequisite for correct Markdown round-tripping. MarkdownShortcutPlugin gives users Obsidian-like shortcuts without a separate preview.

---

## Phase 8 — Theming

---

- [ ] **T-019 — Define Theme data model, defaults, and app settings**
  - **Goal**: Theme config type is already in T-001. Create default theme values, a ThemeContext, and a lightweight app settings store for non-theme preferences (starting with auto-save toggle).
  - **Files to create**: `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`, `src/lib/themes.ts`, `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx`
  - **ThemeContext exports**: `DEFAULT_THEME: Theme`, `applyTheme(theme: Theme): void` (sets CSS custom properties), `ThemeContext`, `ThemeProvider`
  - **SettingsContext exports**: `SettingsContext`, `SettingsProvider`, `useSettings()` — initial settings shape: `{ autoSave: boolean }`. Persisted to `localStorage` (no project dependency; these are per-device preferences).
  - **Approach**: Theme values are applied as CSS custom properties on `:root`. Tailwind classes reference these vars where needed.
  - **Depends on**: T-001
  - **Fits architecture**: CSS custom properties decouple theming from Tailwind utility regeneration. Settings are intentionally separate from `Project` — they are user preferences, not project data.

- [ ] **T-020 — Implement Tauri commands: save_theme, list_themes**
  - **Goal**: Persist themes to the `themes/` directory of the active project.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Commands**: `save_theme(project_path: String, theme: Theme) -> Result<(), String>`, `list_themes(project_path: String) -> Result<Vec<Theme>, String>`, `load_theme(project_path: String, name: String) -> Result<Theme, String>`
  - **Depends on**: T-002, T-003
  - **Fits architecture**: Theme files live inside the project directory, making them project-specific and Git-trackable.

---

- [ ] **T-021 — Build Theme Settings panel**
  - **Goal**: UI for editing and saving themes, accessible from the sidebar or a settings area.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/panels/ThemePanel.tsx`
  - **Features**: Font family picker, font size slider, line height, background colour, text colour. Live preview as you adjust. Save/name a theme. Load saved themes.
  - **Depends on**: T-019, T-020, T-013
  - **Fits architecture**: Another sidebar panel. Could also be triggered from a toolbar.

## Phase 9 — AI Sidebar Infrastructure (Placeholder)

_No AI features are built yet. This phase ensures the sidebar and data access patterns are ready for a future AI panel without requiring code changes to the core editor._

---

- [ ] **T-022 — Add AI panel placeholder to sidebar**
  - **Goal**: Add an AI icon to the sidebar icon strip that opens a placeholder panel with a text input and "coming soon" message.
  - **Files to create**: `src/components/panels/AIPanel.tsx`
  - **Files to modify**: `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
  - **Depends on**: T-013
  - **Fits architecture**: Per PRD — "UI and product design should be designed such that it is an easy and obvious addition". The slot exists; filling it is a future task.

## Phase 10 — Polish & Window Configuration

---

- [ ] **T-023 — Update window configuration**
  - **Goal**: Set a more appropriate default window size and min-size.
  - **Files to modify**: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
  - **Changes**: `width: 1280, height: 800, minWidth: 900, minHeight: 600`
  - **Depends on**: nothing
  - **Fits architecture**: 800×600 is too small for a 2-pane writing app.

---

- [ ] **T-024 — Add word count to chapter list and status bar**
  - **Goal**: Show word count per chapter in the chapter list and a live word count for the current chapter.
  - **Files to modify**: `src/components/ChapterList.tsx`, `src/Editor.tsx`
  - **Approach**: Count words in the Markdown string on every auto-save tick; store in chapter metadata or compute live.
  - **Depends on**: T-010, T-012
  - **Fits architecture**: Word count is a common distraction-free writing feature that doesn't add UI chrome.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~~OQ-1~~ | ~~Chapter ordering via filename prefix vs. manifest~~ | —       | **Resolved**: manifest wins. Order stored in `project.json`'s `chapters` array. Filenames are plain slugs with no numeric prefix. See T-001, T-003, T-004.                                                                                                                                |
| ~~OQ-2~~ | ~~Lexical Markdown fidelity~~                         | —       | **Resolved**: CommonMark only for now via `WEAVER_TRANSFORMERS` (extension array in `src/lib/markdown.ts`). Future Pandoc transformers added there. YAML frontmatter not needed — pandoc-publish uses a separate metadata file edited via the file view (T-010, T-011).                   |
| ~~OQ-3~~ | ~~Auto-save vs. manual save~~                         | —       | **Resolved**: implement both. Auto-save on 1s debounce + Ctrl+S for immediate save. Add a user setting to disable auto-save. See T-012, T-019.                                                                                                                                            |
| ~~OQ-4~~ | ~~Codex entry editor~~                                | —       | **Resolved**: full Lexical editor. Writers may want stylized text in codex entries (bold, italic, etc.) even if they're reference notes. Use the same Markdown ↔ Lexical serialization as chapters. See T-016.                                                                            |
| ~~OQ-5~~ | ~~Outline anchor strategy~~                           | —       | **Resolved**: HTML comment anchors in Markdown (`<!-- weaver-anchor:UUID -->`), represented as invisible `AnchorNode` decorator nodes in Lexical. Survives save/load cycles and text edits. `OutlineItem.anchorId: string` replaces offset fields. See T-001, T-002, T-011, T-014, T-015. |
